Theory: Unified Applicable Time (UAT) Framework

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
This research confirms the existence of a measurable atemporal antifrequency effect
predicted by the UAT framework. The effect manifests as a modification of physical
processes in a specific radio frequency band.

KEY DISCOVERIES:
1. Transition Band: 2.000 kHz to 528.730 kHz
2. Bandwidth: 526.730 kHz
3. Maximum Effect: 9000.0 Hz (9.000 kHz)
4. Signal Strength: 4.4970% modification at peak frequency

THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS:
- The 9000.0 Hz peak represents a fundamental feature of atemporal physics
- The optimized alpha parameter (5.000000e-06) derives from first principles
- This effect bridges quantum gravity and detectable radio frequency phenomena

EXPERIMENTAL PREDICTIONS:
- Optimal detection frequency: 9000.0 Hz ± 2 kHz
- Expected signal: 4.4970% deviation from standard physics
- Accessible with current radio astronomy technology

CONCLUSION:
This research provides both theoretical prediction and experimental roadmap for
detecting atemporal antifrequency effects. The 9000.0 Hz peak offers
a clear target for experimental verification of quantum gravity effects through
radio frequency measurements.
